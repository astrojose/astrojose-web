Like other technical skills, understanding and getting started with Commandline Interface can be daunting. But it becomes straight-forward when you take some time and get use to it. 

### What is commandline interface(CLI)?
>"In the beginning ... there was a commandline" - Johnson Stephenson  

Commandline interface is the way of intereacting with the computer by typing comnands that are then interpreted as instructions to specific task to be performed(hence, command).  
In early computers, commandline interface(cli) was a primary method of interaction which was then preceeded by dominance of graphical interface.

### And then, graphical user interface(GUI).
Graphical user interface is another method of interacting with the computer based on use of graphical representation of computer operations. The representation is broken down into objects like buttons, windows, input boxes, which are then navigated using a movable graphical pointer controlled by a mouse or trackpad. 

### Some architecture. 
Technically, all the operations of a computer are determined by the operating system(OS). The OS controls the use of computer resources like CPU, Memory, devices to meet the user's computing requirements. At the core of OS lies a *kernel*, a component that interacts with actual machine hardware. Kernel takes input from system or user application as *system calls* and it controls the processing by interacting with CPU, Memory, Input/Output devices and devices needed for task completion. In other words, it has complete control on how the computer operates.  

Graphical Interface is more abstracted in making system calls(kernel interactions) compared to Commandline Interface.In CLI,*Shell* takes input from user as commands and resolve them to programs(e.g ls) and related system calls that manages execution of the required programs. It is called shell because it surrounds(interfaces) the kernel. The user can interact directly with kernel by executing system calls.
