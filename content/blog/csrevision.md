Due to massive advancement of computer technology, the concepts too  abstracted that to the point  where its nearly impossible to understand the fundamental concepts. Current frameworks and tools are build in a way that not knowing what's going on behind the scene is not a problem.   
Things goes well until they don't. Having a clue of what is behind that fancy functionality is a kind of superpower.

## disclaimer
In this article **Computer Science** is not used to strictly mean a tradition college degree. Instead the term is used to mean the **fundamental computer concepts** surrounding your work as software developer. And by any means, I am not an expert in cs, I share thoughts that are useful to me.. and might be on you.

## some cases where the blindness is evil 
In this are areas where it is vital to always rethink the fundamentals, lot of edge cases and suprises.   
- Practical AI and Deep learning, autonomous driving problems. 
- IOT where there is connection of a lot of different devices.
- Programming language and compliler development.  

This should not be limited into these cases. To better your development game, always rethink the cs behind what you are doing. 


## defining computer science
>science is is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>  

Considering the presence of **science** in the term, **Computer science** can be defined as a discipline (branch of knowledge) that involves study of computers and computational systems. It is both theoretical and practical discipline   
- **Theoretical discpline**
This is research and abstract modeling of computation and information theories e.g theories of algorithms, data structures, compilers, abstract maths and information.
- **Practical discpline**
The application of theories to implement solutions to different computational problems e.g  programming languages, computer architectures and artificial intelligence. This is where the fundamentals of software design and implementation are developed. 

## computer science and software engineering
As a developer at work, you are the later. Computer science lays down the fundamentals, Software engineering  applies the laid fundamentals in building scalable and reliable computer systems. These are two mindsets you have to keep in sync. 

>By forcing the divorce of these disciplines is the source of evil.    

## meaning of compupter science to a developer
Software development as an intellectual work, it demands some form of thinking for you make sense of the development environment and processes. This is **Computational Thinking**, mindset for solving problem by logically processing information.  The core of programming language is teaching you computational thinking. Think, you are already a builder, to master your craft, you need to equip yourself with the principles of building. 
    
## upsides of more computer science
- In programming, problem-solving depends a lot on how you frame a problem. For example, by understanding data structures.. you will have a clue whether to use arrays or linked-lists. Understanding cs fundamentals makes your design and implementation decisions more accurate and reliable.
- Boosting debugging skills, a bug puts programmers into heavy classes to find why they exist. Having fundamentals on the subject becomes helpful.. Debugging server errors are less tiresome if you are equiped with networking concepts.

## what makes it hard to learn 
- Formal training, at least at undergrad-level, is less focused on practicing and uderstand concept more of speed to keep up with syllabus. It is a good intro though.
- Computer science is very dense and subject, need a lot of time and practices to master concepts. Its even harder for self-taught developers. 
- At college some students are not motivated on the subject because they are not sure if it has practical use in your life. You did for grades, now you do it to improve code and thinking.
    
## better ways to learn cs
Some learn well on texts while other are better in video courses, some do better with formal style, while others comes with their own styles. For better results combine these methods based on what works better for you. 
> Its better to pivot your current skills on the subject, so you will know what you want to know. This is you being interest-based. 

### customization of the formal training 
> Choose the topic and go deep with it.  

Here you are trying to approach little differently from tradition approach. Your task is to structure the academic method into your need. With internet you have an ability to access learning materials from world level academic institutions. 

- MIT has [OpenCourseWare](https://ocwmit.edu/index.htm) which is free web-based publication ofeducational materials of ther undergraduage- andgraduate-level courses. 
- Take the benefit of [MOOCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) like [Coursera] (https://www.coursera.org/) 

### text books
Books are good in learning and understanding techinical concepts. Read and practice.

### online
Research the specific problem on internet, you dont have to know everything instantly, embrace the **incremental learning**. This approach may help to handle the complexity of computer science. 
The most important thing here is to **apply new skills quickly.**

> The goal is to breakdown skills into microbehaviors, that you can internalize into your skillset. Keep fresh with fundamentals, escape the cloud of  mediocrity.
